# Python-Essentials-1
This project showcases my progress and understanding of fundamental Python programming concepts. It includes exercises and examples of basic syntax, data types, variables, control flow, and functions. As I continue to learn and grow in my Python skills, I will update this repository with new examples and challenges. Feel free to browse through the code and see my development as a Python programmer.
