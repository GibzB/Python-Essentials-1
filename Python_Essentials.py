#Your task is to:

#1. create the variables: john, mary, and adam;
#2. assign values to the variables. The values must be equal to the numbers of fruit possessed by John, Mary, and Adam respectively;
#3. having stored the numbers in the variables, print the variables on one line, 
#   and separate each of them with a comma;
#4. now create a new variable named total_apples equal to the addition of the three previous variables.
#5. print the value stored in total_apples to the console;
#6. experiment with your code: create new variables, assign different values to them, and perform various arithmetic operations on them (e.g., +, -, *, /, //, etc.). Try to print a string and an integer together on one line, e.g., "Total number of apples:" and total_apples.

#Solution:

The most important tax, called the Personal Income Tax (PIT for short) had to be paid once a year, and was evaluated using the following rule:

# if the citizen's income was not higher than 85,528 thalers, the tax was equal to 18% of the income minus 556 thalers and 2 cents (this was what they called tax relief)

# For Loops
# Using the range() function
for i in range(10): 
    print("The value of i is currently", i) # Prints consequent numbers starting from zero

# Using 2 arguements in the range() function
for i in range(2, 8): 
    # The first argument determines the initial (first) value of the control variable.
    # The last argument shows the first value the control variable will not be assigned.
    print("The value of i is currently", i)

# Using 3 arguements in the range() function
for i in range(2, 8, 3):
    print("The value of i is currently", i)

# Explanation: 2 (starting number) â†’ 5 (2 increment by 3 equals 5 â€“ the number is within the range from 2 to 8)
#  â†’ 8 (5 increment by 3 equals 8 â€“ the number is not within the range from 2 to 8, 
# because the stop parameter is not included in the sequence of numbers generated by the function.)


# Particular Range() Situations that result to No Outputs 
# 1. Where range() function is empty
for i in range(1, 1):
    print("The value of i is currently", i)



# 2.  Where the set generated by the range() has to be sorted in ascending order
#   There's no way to force the range() to create a set in a different form when the range() function accepts exactly two arguments. 
#   This means that the range()'s second argument must be GREATER than the first
for i in range(2, 1):
    print("The value of i is currently", i)

# Program whose task is to write some of the first powers of two
starting_number = 1
for exponent in range(16):
