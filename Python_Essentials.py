#Your task is to:

#1. create the variables: john, mary, and adam;
#2. assign values to the variables. The values must be equal to the numbers of fruit possessed by John, Mary, and Adam respectively;
#3. having stored the numbers in the variables, print the variables on one line, 
#   and separate each of them with a comma;
#4. now create a new variable named total_apples equal to the addition of the three previous variables.
#5. print the value stored in total_apples to the console;
#6. experiment with your code: create new variables, assign different values to them, and perform various arithmetic operations on them (e.g., +, -, *, /, //, etc.). Try to print a string and an integer together on one line, e.g., "Total number of apples:" and total_apples.

#Solution:

The most important tax, called the Personal Income Tax (PIT for short) had to be paid once a year, and was evaluated using the following rule:

# if the citizen's income was not higher than 85,528 thalers, the tax was equal to 18% of the income minus 556 thalers and 2 cents (this was what they called tax relief)

# LAB   The break statement â€“ Stuck in a loop

#  The break statement is used to exit/terminate a loop.
#  Design a program that uses a while loop and continuously asks the user to enter a word unless the user enters "chupacabra" 
#  as the secret exit word, in which case the message "You've successfully left the loop." should be printed to the screen, and the loop should terminate.

# Don't print any of the words entered by the user. Use the concept of conditional execution and the break statement.

# Solution:

#  LAB   Essentials of the while loop

# Scenario
# Listen to this story: a boy and his father, a computer programmer, are playing with wooden blocks. They are building a pyramid.
# Their pyramid is a bit weird, as it is actually a pyramid-shaped wall â€“ it's flat. 
# The pyramid is stacked according to one simple principle: each lower layer contains one block more than the layer above.

# Your task is to write a program which reads the number of blocks the builders have, 
# and outputs the height of the pyramid that can be built using these blocks.

# Test Data: Sample input: 6        Expected output:  The height of the pyramid: 3
#            Sample input: 20       Expected output:  The height of the pyramid: 3
#            Sample input: 1000     Expected output:  The height of the pyramid: 44

#   LAB   Collatz's hypothesis
#   Scenario
# In 1937, a German mathematician named Lothar Collatz formulated an intriguing hypothesis (it still remains unproven) which can be described in the following way:take any non-negative and non-zero integer number and name it c0;
#       if it's even, evaluate a new c0 as c0 Ã· 2;
#       otherwise, if it's odd, evaluate a new c0 as 3 Ã— c0 + 1;
#       if c0 â‰  1, go back to point 2.
# The hypothesis says that regardless of the initial value of c0, it will always go to 1.
# Of course, it's an extremely complex task to use a computer in order to prove the hypothesis for any natural number (it may even require artificial intelligence), but you can use Python to check some individual numbers. Maybe you'll even find the one which would disprove the hypothesis.
# Write a program which reads one natural number and executes the above steps as long as c0 remains different from 1. We also want you to count the steps needed to achieve the goal. Your code should output all the intermediate values of c0, too.
#   Hint: the most important part of the problem is how to transform Collatz's idea into a while loop â€“ this is the key to success.

# SOLUTION
c0 = int(input("Enter c0: "))

if c0 > 1:
	steps = 0

			cnew = 3 * c0 + 1
