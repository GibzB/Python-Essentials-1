#LAB: Variable
# Scenario
#Here is a short story:

# Once upon a time in Appleland, John had three apples, Mary had five apples, and Adam had six apples. 
# They were all very happy and lived for a long time. End of story.

#Your task is to:

#1. create the variables: john, mary, and adam;
#2. assign values to the variables. The values must be equal to the numbers of fruit possessed by John, Mary, and Adam respectively;
#3. having stored the numbers in the variables, print the variables on one line, 
#   and separate each of them with a comma;
#4. now create a new variable named total_apples equal to the addition of the three previous variables.
#5. print the value stored in total_apples to the console;
#6. experiment with your code: create new variables, assign different values to them, and perform various arithmetic operations on them (e.g., +, -, *, /, //, etc.). Try to print a string and an integer together on one line, e.g., "Total number of apples:" and total_apples.

#Solution:
john_apples = 3
mary_apples = 5
adam_apples = 6
total_apples = (john_apples + mary_apples + adam_apples)
print(john_apples,mary_apples,adam_apples, sep=',')
print(total_apples)
print('Total number of apples:', total_apples)

#  LAB   Variables â€’ a simple converter

# Miles and kilometers are units of length or distance.
# Bearing in mind that 1 mile is equal to approximately 1.61 kilometers, complete the program in the editor so that it converts:

#miles to kilometers;
#kilometers to miles.
#Do not change anything in the existing code. Write your code in the places indicated by ###. Test your program with the data we've provided in the source code.

#Pay particular attention to what is going on inside the print() function. 
# Analyze how we provide multiple arguments to the function, and how we output the expected data.

#Note that some of the arguments inside the print() function are strings (e.g., "miles is", whereas some other are variables (e.g., miles).

# Expected output
# 7.38 miles is 11.88 kilometers
# 12.25 kilometers is 7.61 miles

# Solution:
kilometers = 12.25
miles = 7.38

miles_to_kilometers = miles * 1.61  
kilometers_to_miles = kilometers / 1.61

#  x =  # Hardcode your test data here.

#   Write your code here.

# Solution:
