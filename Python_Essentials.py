#Use apostrophe and quote interchangeably to delimit strings , but they must be used consistently

#Lab Scenario: Write a one-line piece of code, using the print() function, 
# as well as the newline and escape characters, to match the expected result outputted on three lines.

# Basic Operators
# They are 


# Exponentiation
# 
print(2 ** 3)
print(2 ** 3.)
print(2. ** 3)

print(2 * 3.)

#Summary Questions
#Question 1: What is the expected output of the following snippet?

print((2 ** 4), (2 * 4.), (2 * 4))

#Question 2: What is the expected output of the following snippet?

print((-2 / 4), (2 / 4), (2 // 4), (-2 // 4))

#Question 3: What is the expected output of the following snippet?

print((2 % -4), (2 % 4), (2 ** 3 ** 2))

#Variables
#Initialising one is as below
var = 1
print(var)

#Print out name of a/c holder using var
var = 1
account_balance = 1000.0
client_name = 'John Doe'
print(var, account_balance, client_name)
print(var)

#Use print() function to combine text and var
var = "3.8.5"
print("Python version: " + var)

#The equal sign is an assignment operator
var = 1
print(var)
var = var + 1
print(var)

#Using var and its assignment power
var = 100
var = 200 + 300
print(var)

#Solving mathematical probles
#Construct a short program solving simple mathematical problems such as the Pythagorean theorem:

a = 3.0
b = 4.0
c = (a ** 2 + b ** 2) ** 0.5
print("c =", c)

#LAB: Variable
# Scenario
#Here is a short story:

# Once upon a time in Appleland, John had three apples, Mary had five apples, and Adam had six apples. 
# They were all very happy and lived for a long time. End of story.

#Your task is to:

#1. create the variables: john, mary, and adam;
#2. assign values to the variables. The values must be equal to the numbers of fruit possessed by John, Mary, and Adam respectively;
#3. having stored the numbers in the variables, print the variables on one line, 
#   and separate each of them with a comma;
#4. now create a new variable named total_apples equal to the addition of the three previous variables.
#5. print the value stored in total_apples to the console;
#6. experiment with your code: create new variables, assign different values to them, and perform various arithmetic operations on them (e.g., +, -, *, /, //, etc.). Try to print a string and an integer together on one line, e.g., "Total number of apples:" and total_apples.

#Solution:
john_apples = 3
mary_apples = 5
adam_apples = 6
total_apples = (john_apples + mary_apples + adam_apples)
print(john_apples,mary_apples,adam_apples, sep=',')
print(total_apples)
print('Total number of apples:', total_apples)

# Shortcut Operators
x = x * 2
sheep = sheep + 1

# Python offers you a shortened way of writing operations like these:
x *= 2
sheep += 1

#  LAB   Variables â€’ a simple converter

# Miles and kilometers are units of length or distance.
# Bearing in mind that 1 mile is equal to approximately 1.61 kilometers, complete the program in the editor so that it converts:

#miles to kilometers;
#kilometers to miles.
#Do not change anything in the existing code. Write your code in the places indicated by ###. Test your program with the data we've provided in the source code.

#Pay particular attention to what is going on inside the print() function. 
# Analyze how we provide multiple arguments to the function, and how we output the expected data.

#Note that some of the arguments inside the print() function are strings (e.g., "miles is", whereas some other are variables (e.g., miles).

# Expected output
# 7.38 miles is 11.88 kilometers
# 12.25 kilometers is 7.61 miles

# Solution:
kilometers = 12.25
miles = 7.38

miles_to_kilometers = miles * 1.61  
kilometers_to_miles = kilometers / 1.61

print(miles, "miles is", round(miles_to_kilometers, 2), "kilometers")
print(kilometers, "kilometers is", round(kilometers_to_miles, 2), "miles")

#  LAB   Operators and expressions

# Scenario
#Take a look at the code in the editor: it reads a float value, puts it into a variable named x, and prints the value of a variable named y. 
# Your task is to complete the code in order to evaluate the following expression:

#    3x3 - 2x2 + 3x - 1

# Note how we change data type to make sure that x is of type float.
# The result should be assigned to y

#  x =  # Hardcode your test data here.
#  x = float(x)
#   Write your code here.
#  print("y =", y)

# Solution:
x = 0
x = float(x)
y = 3 * x**3 - 2 * x**2 + 3 * x - 1
print("y =", y)

x = 1
x = float(x)
y = 3 * x**3 - 2 * x**2 + 3 * x - 1
print("y =", y)

x = -1
x = float(x)
y = 3 * x**3 - 2 * x**2 + 3 * x - 1
print("y =", y)


# LAB   Comments
# Scenario
# The code in the editor contains comments. Try to improve it: 
# add or remove comments where you find it appropriate (yes, sometimes removing a comment can make the code more readable), 
# and change variable names where you think this will improve code comprehension.

# this program computes the number of seconds in a given number of hours
# this program has been written two days ago

# print("Seconds in Hours: ", a * seconds) # printing the number of seconds in a given number of hours

#here we should also print "Goodbye", but a programmer didn't have time to write any code
#this is the end of the program that computes the number of seconds in 3 hour

# Solution:
#this program computes the number of seconds in a given number of hours
# this program has been written two days ago

a = 2 # number of hours
b = 3 # number of hours
seconds = 3600 # number of seconds in 1 hour
