#Your task is to:

#1. create the variables: john, mary, and adam;
#2. assign values to the variables. The values must be equal to the numbers of fruit possessed by John, Mary, and Adam respectively;
#3. having stored the numbers in the variables, print the variables on one line, 
#   and separate each of them with a comma;
#4. now create a new variable named total_apples equal to the addition of the three previous variables.
#5. print the value stored in total_apples to the console;
#6. experiment with your code: create new variables, assign different values to them, and perform various arithmetic operations on them (e.g., +, -, *, /, //, etc.). Try to print a string and an integer together on one line, e.g., "Total number of apples:" and total_apples.

#Solution:

The most important tax, called the Personal Income Tax (PIT for short) had to be paid once a year, and was evaluated using the following rule:

# if the citizen's income was not higher than 85,528 thalers, the tax was equal to 18% of the income minus 556 thalers and 2 cents (this was what they called tax relief)

#  The break statement is used to exit/terminate a loop.
#  Design a program that uses a while loop and continuously asks the user to enter a word unless the user enters "chupacabra" 
#  as the secret exit word, in which case the message "You've successfully left the loop." should be printed to the screen, and the loop should terminate.

# Don't print any of the words entered by the user. Use the concept of conditional execution and the break statement.

# Scenario
# Listen to this story: a boy and his father, a computer programmer, are playing with wooden blocks. They are building a pyramid.
# Their pyramid is a bit weird, as it is actually a pyramid-shaped wall â€“ it's flat. 
# The pyramid is stacked according to one simple principle: each lower layer contains one block more than the layer above.

# Your task is to write a program which reads the number of blocks the builders have, 
# and outputs the height of the pyramid that can be built using these blocks.

# Test Data: Sample input: 6        Expected output:  The height of the pyramid: 3
#            Sample input: 20       Expected output:  The height of the pyramid: 3

#   LAB   Collatz's hypothesis
#   Scenario
# In 1937, a German mathematician named Lothar Collatz formulated an intriguing hypothesis (it still remains unproven) which can be described in the following way:take any non-negative and non-zero integer number and name it c0;
#       if it's even, evaluate a new c0 as c0 Ã· 2;
#       otherwise, if it's odd, evaluate a new c0 as 3 Ã— c0 + 1;
#       if c0 â‰  1, go back to point 2.
# The hypothesis says that regardless of the initial value of c0, it will always go to 1.
# Of course, it's an extremely complex task to use a computer in order to prove the hypothesis for any natural number (it may even require artificial intelligence), but you can use Python to check some individual numbers. Maybe you'll even find the one which would disprove the hypothesis.
# Write a program which reads one natural number and executes the above steps as long as c0 remains different from 1. We also want you to count the steps needed to achieve the goal. Your code should output all the intermediate values of c0, too.
#   Hint: the most important part of the problem is how to transform Collatz's idea into a while loop â€“ this is the key to success.

# SOLUTION
c0 = int(input("Enter c0: "))

if c0 > 1:
	steps = 0

# LAB
#  LAB   Prime numbers â€’ how to find them
# A natural number is prime if it is greater than 1 and has no divisors other than 1 and itself.

# Complicated? Not at all. For example, 8 isn't a prime number, as you can divide it by 2 and 4 (we can't use divisors equal to 1 and 8, as the definition prohibits this).

# On the other hand, 7 is a prime number, as we can't find any legal divisors for it.

#  Your task is to write a function checking whether a number is prime or not.

# The function:

# is called is_prime;
# takes one argument (the value to check)
# returns True if the argument is a prime number, and False otherwise.

#   Hint: 
#   Try to divide the argument by all subsequent values (starting from 2) and check the remainder â€’ if it's zero, 
#   your number cannot be a prime; think carefully about when you should stop the process.

# If you need to know the square root of any value, you can utilize the ** operator. 
# Remember: the square root of x is the same as x0.5

#Complete the code in the editor.

#  The global keyword allows you to modify a variable outside of the current scope.

# A SEQUENCE is a type of data in Python which is able to store more than one value (or less than one, as a sequence may be empty), 
# and these values can be sequentially (hence the name) browsed, element by element.

# The list is a classic example of a Python sequence

# MUTABILITY âˆ’ is a property of any Python data that describes its readiness to be freely changed during program execution.
# A mutable object can be changed after it's created.
# An immutable object can't be changed after it's created.

# Dictionary METHODS & FUNCTIONS
# 1. The keys() method returns a list of all the keys in the dictionary.
dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}
 
for key in dictionary.keys():
    print(key, "->", dictionary[key]

# 2. The values() method returns a list of all the values in the dictionary.
dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}

# 3. The items() method returns a list of tuples of key-value pairs in the dictionary.
dictionary = {"cat": "chat", "dog": "chien", "horse": "cheval"}
 
for english, french in dictionary.items():
    print(english, "->", french)


# 4. The get() method returns the value for the given key, if present in the dictionary. If not, it returns None (if get() is called with only one argument).
# 5. The pop() method removes the element with the specified key and returns its value.
# 6. The popitem() method removes the last inserted key-value pair from the dictionary.
# 7. The clear() method removes all the elements from the dictionary.
# 8. The update() method updates the dictionary with the elements from the another dictionary object or from an iterable of key-value pairs.
# 9. The setdefault() method returns the value of the item with the specified key. If the key does not exist, insert the key, with the specified value.
# 10. The copy() method returns a shallow copy of the dictionary.
# 11. The fromkeys() method returns a dictionary with the specified keys and value.
# 12. The has_key() method returns true if a dictionary has the specified key, otherwise it returns false.
# 13. The iteritems() method returns an iterator for the dictionary.
# 14. The iterkeys() method returns an iterator for the keys of the dictionary.
# 15. The itervalues() method returns an iterator for the values of the dictionary.
# 16. The viewitems() method returns a view object that displays a list of dictionary's (key, value) tuple pair.
# 17. The viewkeys() method returns a view object that displays a list of all the keys in the dictionary.
